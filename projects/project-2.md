This is a simple calculator implemented as an Android application, which I developed in preparation for my junior project, EE 396. Using Android Studios, I developed my first Android app which I ran and tested on a virtual android device and eventually on an actual device. Through this project, I learned a new programming language, Java, as well as how to implement the UI of Android Apps.
