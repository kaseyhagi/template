This is a simple calculator implemented as an Android application, which I developed in preparation for my junior project, EE 396. The purpose of this project, was mainly to learn and become familiar with Android development and the Android development IDE, Android Studios. Using Android Studios, I developed my first Android app which I ran and tested on a virtual android device and eventually on an actual device. The simple calculator I created implemented all basic calculations such as addition, multiplication, subtraction, and division. I first designed the interface in XML, and added a View Group for each button and the text view that would display the calculations. Next, I implemented a click listener, which is what handles each button click. I then made a Java class, which would call the correct function for each operation upon button click. 
Through this project, I learned a new programming language, Java, as well as XML, which handles the implementation of the UI. I had to read up on all the different types of layouts to find the layout most suitable for this project. One challenge I faced was trying to get the layout to look exactly the same on different devices with different screen sizes. I also learned about how to handle click listeners. One of the biggest challenges I faced was to make this application "unbreakable". I felt it was important to have an app that did not crash when unexpected buttons were clicked or operations such as dividing by zero were entered. This coming semester, I will use these new skills to develop another app which will be utilizing google maps and location services.
