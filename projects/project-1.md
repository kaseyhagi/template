This was a group project for EE 205 Object-Oriented Programming. We created a matrix calculator with a GUI implemented in C++ with the Qt Creator IDE. This project had an emphasis on C++ features such as operator and function overloading and layering. We used the Qt creator and included the Qt libraries to form our user interface. For this project, I wrote the class declarations an functions for all of the calculator's operations. I also assisted in the design of the GUI and debugging. The final application was an executable cross-platform application.
