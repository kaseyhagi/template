## Objective

Moar Chow is a web application tailored for hungry UH Manoa students. This app allows students to find information on all food vendors on campus including mobile food trucks. The users can view menus, operating hours, and details on each vendor. Users also can save vendors to their "Favorites", which will show up on their home page anytime they login and they can quickly find out if their favorite vendors are currenlty open. 

## My Contributions

Moar Chow is a group project for a course ICS 314, Software Engineering. The contributions I made included the user functionality such as rating vendors and favoriting vendors. I also added the feature to specify whether a vendor is open or closed at the current time.
