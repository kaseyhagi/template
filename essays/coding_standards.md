## Coding Standards
In software engineering, adhering to coding standards is very important. Coding standards keep code in a basic format or layout. Having a standard for coding practices makes the software engineering process much easier. Software Engineers rarely work alone on a project from start to finish. Often, they work on code that has already been created and they must read and understand what has already been done. Coding standards simplify this process. When code is written to a standard, it is easier to be maintained and improved by another author because they can focus more on the content than trying to understand they layout. 

In my experience, I have noticed working with other students who write little to no documentation and it takes a while longer just to understand the code they've written. Sometimes I even will take the time out to revise their code in a way that is easier to understand. I imagine

ESLint is a java utility for recognizing patterns that don't adhere to coding standards. I feel using ESLint is great to train yourself to follow coding standards. Though you can write code that works that doesn't follow standards, ESLint will have your code looking neat and understandable. ESLint encourages better coding practices. I've noticed that for example, ESLint doesn't like string concatenation and prefers template literal form, which is an easier and faster way of doing it. Not only will ESLint help you follow standards, it will also catch some e

Integrating ESLint into IntelliJ is great training for applying coding standards.
