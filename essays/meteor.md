At first, Meteor may seem like the enemy. I procrastinated so hard the past two weeks, trying to avoid having to deal with Meteor. In the beginning, most of us had to jump through hoops just to get meteor to work. If you're just starting with Meteor, don't be discouraged if it doesn't work right out of the box. Just go with it, find out why it doesn't work --actually read the errors! This process really builds character, it tests your patience and your dedication. 

## Give it a chance

Yes, meteor takes time. When you're loading up your project, it may take a few minutes for the page to build but just be patient. You won't regret it either. Learning Meteor was my first experience in the realm of web applications. I didn't think developing web applications could be so easy! The meteor example <a href="http://ics-software-engineering.github.io/meteor-application-template/"> template </a> was an excellent guide in the learning process. I started with building pages based off the template pages and slowly began to understand the way meteor does things. 
Using this platform is a quickstart way into the web application development business. Meteor allows for quick and easy prototyping for web apps.

## Out of this world  
Hence the name of this platform, Meteor is out of this world. I have no idea what's going on behind the curtains. I have no idea how the Web actually works and I'm kind of glad that Meteor handles all of this stuff for me. After going through the processes and following the template, I have a basic grasp of meteor. Meteor does some pretty cool things, like automatically updating your changes to the app. I liked that I could immediately see the changes I've made without having to type a command. Since I had no previous knowledge of how web-based applications worked, Meteor taught me a little bit of it along the way.
