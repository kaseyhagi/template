I first realized that I wanted to explore engineering while taking my first calculus class. At this time, I was a business major that calculus wasnâ€™t even a requirement for. I had a passion for topics that challenged me. After that semester, I stopped attending university and enrolled at a community college where I took more calculus classes, chemistry, physics, and my first programming class. Writing programs was challenging, but at the end very rewarding.  Writing instructions for a computer to perform seemed so fascinating to me and the logical process in which programs are written just made so much sense. I chose computer engineering because I wanted to know more than just how to write code. I chose engineering because I wanted to know how computers worked down to the core. 

As I ventured further into my education, I met other students who shared the same passion. I have learned so much more by working with other students and to be able to bounce ideas back and forth. One skill I do hope to expand on it the ability to work on code written by someone else. Currently, this is not an easy task because we do not all have the same approach to a problem so it takes time to sit down, read the code, and understand what they are trying to do. 

I would like to experience working on a project with students from other disciplines. It is interesting to talk to other engineering students in different concentrations and to work with them on a project, I feel would be a great learning experience. Throughout the rest of my journey, I only hope to become more knowledgeable in the engineering field and gain greater understanding of computers.
