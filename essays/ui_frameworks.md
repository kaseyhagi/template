User interface is one of the most important things when developing Web applications. Frameworks make it possible to make web applications that will work on all types of screens, from desktops to smart phones or tablets. Using frameworks adjust the web application to the size of the screen. Frameworks allow you to design a layout without having to make specifications for different devices.
Semantic UI makes implementing the UI much less painless and much nicer to look at. 

WHAT ARE UI FRAMEWORKS? 
WHY DO WE USE THEM? 
WHY NOT USE RAW HTML & CSS?
-IT IS A PAIN
-SEMANTIC UI MAKES THINGS EASY AND PRETTY

## Semantic UI

Semantic UI has tons of libraries that do most of the formatting for you. It isn't too hard to start using, since the framework uses "human-friendly" HTML.

For example, the image to the left is originally a square. To make this round, I just added the class "ui small circular image". With no additional CSS, the image is formatted to size small and appears circular.
But wait, there's more. There's a ton of other ways Semantic UI will make your life easier. I personally found it terribly painful to design a layout in raw HTML/CSS. However using Semantic UI, 

A fun frameworks exercises is to use Semantic UI to replicate a website of your choosing. This was a challenging, yet rewarding exercise for me. You gain experience creating things that all "real" websites have, like some title or menu bar at the top with dropdown options, and often a block-like body with some content. Take a look at my example of replicating <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/"> Arduino's</a> homepage.
<!--<img class="ui medium floated image"src="../images/arduino_before">-->
<!--<img class="ui medium floated image"src="../images/arduino_after">-->

<div class="ui one column grid">
  <div class="column">
    <div class="ui fluid image">
      <div class="ui red right ribbon label">
        Before
      </div>
      <img src="/images/arduino_before.JPG">
    </div>
    <p>The before photo is modified a little to include the footer at the bottom of the page. There are some minor differences in my version compared to the original but it's pretty close. </p>
    <div class="ui fluid image">
      <div class="ui red right ribbon label">
        After
      </div>
      <img src="/images/arduino_after.JPG">
    </div>
  </div>
</div>


If I were told to replicate the same sight using only raw HTML and CSS in the same amount of time, I'd say impossible!
## UI Frameworks for an Engineer


SOFFTWARE ENGINEERING BENEFITS:;
- BE ABLE TO QUICKLY DEVELOP BEAUTIFUL WEB APPLICATIONS 
As an aspiring software engineer, I do not want to spend hours on the user interface, though I would like it to look nice. Doing this with raw HTML and CSS is not an easy task to accomplish. I've noticed quite an improvement in productivity when using Semantic UI.
