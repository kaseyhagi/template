User interface is one of the most important things when developing Web applications. Frameworks make it possible to make web applications that will work on all types of screens, from desktops to smart phones or tablets. Using frameworks adjust the web application to the size of the screen. Frameworks allow you to design a layout without having to make specifications for different devices.
Semantic UI makes implementing the UI much less painless and much nicer to look at.

<img class= "ui middle aligned right floated small circular image" src="../images/semantic_profile.png">
<span>For example, if you </span>

A fun way to exercise using frameworks is by picking a website and replicating it using Semantic UI. 
## UI Frameworks for an Engineer
SOFFTWARE ENGINEERING BENEFITS:;
- BE ABLE TO QUICKLY DEVELOP BEAUTIFUL WEB APPLICATIONS 
As an aspiring software engineer, I do not want to spend hours on the user interface, though I would like it to look nice. Doing this with raw HTML and CSS is not an easy task to accomplish. I've noticed quite an improvement in productivity when using Semantic UI.
