User interface is one of the most important things when developing Web applications. Frameworks make it possible to make web applications that will work on all types of screens, from desktops to smart phones or tablets. Using frameworks adjust the web application to the size of the screen. Frameworks allow you to design a layout without having to make specifications for different devices.
Semantic UI makes implementing the UI much less painless and much nicer to look at. 

<input type="text" placeholder="Search..."><button type="button">Search</button>

<div class="ui action input">
  <input type="text" placeholder="Search...">
  <button class="ui button">Search</button>
</div>
 
Here are two examples of a search bar. Can you tell which is made with Semantic UI and which is with raw HTML? Of course you can. The first looks quite outdated, doesn't it? We need to keep up with the rest of the web, and that doesn't mean adding multiple modifications to your stylesheet. It means using a framework like Semantic UI. With Semantic UI, using about just as much HTML would bring your site into this century.

## Semantic UI

<a href="http://semantic-ui.com/">Semantic UI</a> has tons of libraries that do most of the formatting for you. It isn't too hard to start using, since the framework uses "human-friendly" HTML. Below are examples of some elements or views that can be done using Semantic UI. Notice the style and how they looks as if they were developed in 2016 and not 1995.

A fun frameworks exercise is to use Semantic UI to replicate a website of your choosing. This was a challenging, yet rewarding exercise for me. I gained a lot of experience from creating things that all "real" websites have, like some menu or title bar at the top and a footer at the bottom of the page. Take a look at my example of replicating <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/"> Arduino's</a> homepage. You don't have to recreate the entire site, just choose some portions to get started. I decided to recreate the menu bar, the footer, and a few of the body elements.

<!--<img class="ui medium floated image"src="../images/arduino_after">-->

<div class="ui one column grid">
  <div class="column">
    <div class="ui fluid image">
      <div class="ui red right ribbon label">
        Before
      </div>
      <img src="/images/arduino_before.JPG">
    </div>
    <p>The before photo is modified a little to include the footer at the bottom of the page. There are some minor differences in my version compared to the original but it's pretty close. </p>
    <div class="ui fluid image">
      <div class="ui red right ribbon label">
        After
      </div>
      <img src="/images/arduino_after.JPG">
    </div>
  </div>
</div>


If I were told to replicate the same sight using only raw HTML and CSS in the same amount of time, I'd say impossible! 

## UI Frameworks for an Engineer


<!--SOFFTWARE ENGINEERING BENEFITS:;-->
<!--- BE ABLE TO QUICKLY DEVELOP BEAUTIFUL WEB APPLICATIONS -->
As an aspiring software engineer, I do not want to spend hours on the user interface, though I would like it to look nice. Doing this with raw HTML and CSS is not an easy task to accomplish. I've noticed quite an improvement in productivity when using Semantic UI.
