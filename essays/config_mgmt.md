## Configuration Management
In software engineering, a very important practice is configuration management. Configuration Management is generally tracking changes in the software development process. Software consists of a large system of code, written collaboratively by a team and maintained over time. For this to be possible, proper configuration management must be utilized. A useful tool is version control. When making changes to code, it is very useful to have a saved copy of the version before any changes. I have noticed that this would be very useful in the debugging process. Another important factor is the ability to collaborate on a software project. 

## Git and GitHub
Git is a very popular tool for configuration management and GitHub is currently the most popular software hosting platform. GitHub utilizes git as well as supporting collaboration with a UI. GitHub is a wonderful tool for software engineers. Git is very useful technology to the software engineer. However, being able to collaborate efficiently is of much importance in the industry. Personally, I started using GitHub before usting git alone. 

## My personal experience with Configuration Management

When I first started programming, I didn't see the need for configuration management. I was working by myself with relatively small chunks of code. I didn't see the real need for it until I started working on bigger projects with a group of three other students. We were novice programmers with not much experience working on big programming projects, and we barely knew what GitHub was let alone how to use it. Our professor suggested GitHub to host our project but at the time, but learning how to use GitHub seemed like unnecessary work. However, it was quite a hassle to be emailing the entire source folder back and forth and eventually having multiple copies of the same project on my computer. If we had the skills at the time and utilized GitHub, the project would have been much less painful. 
I started using GitHub for Android app development, and I have found that GitHub made the process a little easier. I started off with a basic app, slowly adding on more complex feature and having previous versions of the program makes the debugging process much simpler than pre-git times. My project partner and I also utilize GitHub to collaborate on our project. Since this is project is bigger than any other project I've worked on, being able to share the entire package is much simpler.
