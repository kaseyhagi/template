When I first started programming, I didn't see the need for configuration management. I was working by myself with relatively small chunks of code. I didn't see the real need for it until I started working on bigger projects with a group of three other students. We were novice programmers with not much experience working on big programming projects, and we barely knew what Github was let alone how to use it. Our professor suggested github to host our project but at the time, learning how to use Github seemed like unnecessary work. However, it was quite a hassle to be emailing the entire source folder back and forth and eventually having multiple copies of the same project on my computer. If we had the skills at the time and utilized GitHub, the project would have been much less painful. 

Configuration management seems to be very important in software engineering. In my experience while developing an android app, this skill became very useful. Many times, it is useful to have previous versions to look back on when a current version just isn't working and you can't figure out why. It comes in handy especially when working on the same code with others. I know that in the real world I won't be working on small projects and version control will take a lot of the pain out of debugging.
When it comes to git and GitHub, I think git is popular because of GitHub. GitHub is such a great tool for coders working on projects. I personally haven't yet needed to use git but saw the need to use GitHub.
